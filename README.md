This guide provides a clear overview of  project structure, necessary dependencies, and step-by-step instructions to set up and run code within a recommended execution environment.
1. Project Structure
Data in the  project is organized as follows . 
project_root/
├── dataset/                 
│   ├── image1.tif
│   ├── image2.tif
│   └── ...
├── labelImages/
│   ├── image1.tif
│   ├── image2.tif
│   └── ..
2. Setup and Dependencies
Create a new environment: The basic command to create an environment is 
conda create --name <environment_name>. You can also specify the Python version and initial packages.
•	To create an empty environment (Python will be installed by default, but no other packages):
conda create --name my_project_env
•	To create an environment with a specific Python version:
conda create --name my_project_env python=3.9
(Replace 3.9 with your desired Python version)
•	To create an environment with specific Python version and packages:
conda create --name my_project_env python=3.9 numpy pandas matplotlib
This will create my_project_env with Python 3.9, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib installed.
•	Activate the environment: After creation, you need to activate the environment to start using it.
conda activate my_project_env
2.3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install all required libraries with 
pip install -r requirements.txt
